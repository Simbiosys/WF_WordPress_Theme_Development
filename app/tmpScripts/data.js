And, I hope we can count on your engagement with the Global Magna Carta project that Sir Tim Berners-Lee is about to launch.</p><p>Ladies and gentleman, here, remotely and even offline. The internet belongs to all of us. An Internet of diversity. An Internet free from mass surveillance. An Internet for all. Diversity: men and women, young and old, rural and city-dwellers, people, challenged, like Judy Okite, my friend from the Free Software and Open Source Foundation for Africa (FOSSFA), people, everywhere.</p><p>Every morning, this what I tell myself:</p><p><strong>All of the people</strong> should be <strong>free and able </strong> to access <strong>all of the Internet,all of the time</strong>.</p><p>All of the people! All of the Internet! All of the time!</p><p>Je Maintiendrai!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>',
